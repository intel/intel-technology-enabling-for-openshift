### Reference Workloads overview
Reference workloads are used to demonstrate and verify Intel hardware features provisioning and e2e solutions on OCP platform. Each workload may use multiple hardware features and related e2e solutions.

#### OpenVINO workload 
[OpenVINO pretrained model](https://docs.openvino.ai/latest/notebooks/101-tensorflow-to-openvino-with-output.html) inference is one of the workloads to enable with dGPU. This workload can also help compare CPU and dGPU performances.
