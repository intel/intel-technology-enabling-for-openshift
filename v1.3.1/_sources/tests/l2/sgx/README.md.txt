### Verify Intel® Software Guard Extensions (Intel® SGX) Provisioning
This [SampleEnclave](https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx/tree/master/SampleCode/SampleEnclave) application workload from the Intel SGX SDK runs an Intel SGX enclave utilizing the EPC resource from the Intel SGX provisioning.
* Build the container image. 
```
$ oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/intel/intel-technology-enabling-for-openshift/v1.3.1/tests/l2/sgx/sgx_build.yaml
```

* Deploy and run the workload.
  
```
$ oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/intel/intel-technology-enabling-for-openshift/v1.3.1/tests/l2/sgx/sgx_job.yaml
```

*	Check the results.
```
