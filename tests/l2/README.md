# Verifying Intel Hardware Feature Provisioning
## Introduction
After provisioning Intel hardware features on RHOCP, the respective hardware resources are exposed to the RHOCP cluster. The workload containers can request these resources. The following sample workloads help verify if these resources can be used as expected. These sample workloads container images are built and packaged on-premises through [RHOCP BuildConfig](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.12/cicd/builds/understanding-buildconfigs.html) and pushed to the embedded repository through [RHOCP ImageStream](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.12/openshift_images/image-streams-manage.html).
## Prerequisites
•	Provisioned RHOCP 4.12 cluster. Follow steps [here](https://github.com/intel/intel-technology-enabling-for-openshift#provisioning-rhocp-cluster). 
•	Provisioning Intel HW features on RHOCP. Follow steps [here](https://github.com/intel/intel-technology-enabling-for-openshift#provisioning-intel-hardware-features-on-rhocp)
### Verify Intel® Software Guard Extensions (Intel® SGX) Provisioning
This [SampleEnclave](https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx/tree/master/SampleCode/SampleEnclave) application workload from the Intel SGX SDK runs an Intel SGX enclave utilizing the EPC resource from the Intel SGX provisioning.
* Build the container image. 
  
```$ oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/intel/intel-technology-enabling-for-openshift/ main/tests/l2/sgx/sgx_build.yaml```

* Deploy and run the workload.
  
```$ oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/intel/intel-technology-enabling-for-openshift/main/tests/l2/sgx/sgx_job.yaml```

*	Check the results.
```$ oc get pods
  intel-sgx-job-4tnh5          0/1     Completed   0          2m10s
  intel-sgx-workload-1-build   0/1     Completed   0          30s
```
```
$ oc logs intel-sgx-job-4tnh5
  Checksum(0x0x7fffac6f41e0, 100) = 0xfffd4143

```
### Verify Intel® Data Center GPU provisioning
This workload runs [clinfo](https://github.com/Oblomov/clinfo) utilizing the i915 resource from GPU provisioning and displays the related GPU information.
*	Build the workload container image. 

```$ oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/intel/intel-technology-enabling-for-openshift/main/tests/l2/dgpu/clinfo_build.yaml ```

*	Deploy and execute the workload.

   For the container to use /dev folder on host, use the ```container_device_t``` selinux option with a custom SCC and service account as below.

```$ oc adm policy add-scc-to-user container-scc -z container-scc```
  
```$ oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/intel/intel-technology-enabling-for-openshift/main/tests/l2/dgpu/container_scc.yaml```

```$ oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/intel/intel-technology-enabling-for-openshift/main/tests/l2/dgpu/clinfo_job.yaml```

* Check the results.
``` 
  $ oc get pods
  intel-dgpu-clinfo-1-build        0/1     Completed   0          3m20s
  intel-dgpu-clinfo-56mh2          0/1     Completed   0          35s
```
```
$ oc logs intel-dgpu-clinfo-56mh2
